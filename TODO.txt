- Maybe get rid of telling people that they should use the long Queue for debugging. Short queue is OK as long as they specify the run time (I think the parameter was "-W").

- Maybe say something about gdb command detach?

- Explain that the developer should use binary search when he isn't certain about where the problem is

- mempatrol / valgrind

- checkpointing

- Deploy debug-tutorial to Git repository available on Mogon
	=> christoph martin, martin Ã¤t uni-mainz.de

- Change #include "selective-debug.h" to #include <selective-debug.h> once we have deployed selective-debug. This needs to be done in debug-tutorial-2-*.c and in selective-gdb.

- Contact Moritz Schlarb (should be listed at Mogon admins)
	- Lessons as sections instead of tables. We need to be able to terminate sections for that:
		https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:outdent
	
	- Show line numbers in code boxes:
		https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:code2
		
	- Show diff-view in preview when editing?

- Link the tutorial in the wiki main page at "Usage"

selective-debug:
	- Deploy selective-debug and header to Mogon using "environment-modules" Framework?
